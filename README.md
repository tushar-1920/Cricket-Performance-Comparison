# -Cricket-Performance-Comparison
This project visualizes the performance of Indian cricketers Virat Kohli and Virender Sehwag using a line graph created with matplotlib in Python. The graph compares their runs scored over a series of years, using distinct markers and styles for each player. It's a beginner-friendly example for anyone learning data visualization with matplotlib.
